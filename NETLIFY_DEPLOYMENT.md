# Lion TV Website - Netlify Deployment Guide

## Overview
Your Lion TV website has been converted to work with Netlify using Netlify Forms for order submissions. This is a fully static site that deploys instantly on Netlify.

## How It Works Now

### Order Flow
1. **Customer selects plans** and adds to cart
2. **Customer fills checkout form** with name, email, phone
3. **Form submits to Netlify Forms** (not a database)
4. **You receive email** at sales@iptvlion.shop with order details
5. **You contact customer** via WhatsApp/Email with payment link
6. **Customer pays** and you send activation codes

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project
The project is already configured for Netlify. No additional setup needed!

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
